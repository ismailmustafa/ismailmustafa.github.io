### Hi, my name is Ismail Mustafa ###
I'm currently a Master's student in Computer Science at NYU. Before pursuing Software
Engineering I graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.
I also freelance iOS apps on the side. My current hobbies include going to hackathons,
learning Haskell, horseback riding with my girlfriend, playing with my little 4 lb
Yorkie Buttons, and exploring New York City.

### Some facts about me ###
* I'm a triple citizen of the USA, Jordan, and Colombia.
* I've never been to Colombia.
* I enjoy browsing Netflix more than I enjoy watching a Netflix movie.
* I like finding great places to eat in NYC.
* I love going on hikes as long as it's not too cold.
